% h is geopotential height. Fake alt that lets us use g0 isntead of g
% h = r/(r+hg)
g0 = 9.8; %gravity at sea level. Will change
r = 32; %radius of earth
ha = hg + r; %absolute height
eq = hg==g0*(r/ha)^2; %equation for gravity at absolute height ha.

syms g real%change this value

sol = solve(eq,g);

solution = double()
